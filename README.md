This is my assignment for cse309 section 2. To run, go to http://localhost/login%20system/login_form.php

If you are a user, you can register your credentials to xampp server, like I added my name Tanvir and stuff
Then you can login
Then you can use the contact form to send info to the server


Next, register as an admin
Then you can login
Then you can view the data a normal user has sent via the contact form
